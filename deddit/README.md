Discussion place (decentralised reddit) that forms part of the Star Sailors webapp suite

# Decentradit.sol
A smart contract for the social networking component of the marketplace, nicknamed "Deddit" aka Decentralised(r)eddit due to the similar UI and style of the Reddit network. 

Trying to investigate how to build a frontend for user posts that interacts with Moralis (and can maybe be taken off Moralis later, to something like Enjin etc) and the game, using the user's Eth account. I want to figure out how to get this to work in conjunction with other player-created networks like matrix-type (e.g. discord servers) instances so we can have an open standard for things like in-game alliances, discussions, transactions and an easy way to view all of them

This can also be translated to working with non-decentralised apps & games.
