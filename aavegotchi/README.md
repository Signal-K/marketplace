Boilerplate project for using the Moralis sdk with our project marketplace
This is the phaser component
Cadence is the web frontend (convert to react native later?)

To-do: insert this into react project (if it works with cadence/onflow.org client library)
Move into phaser three.js (3d phaser) with the same blockchain code after this (integrating with unity, generating additional scenes for trailer, companion app/trial game)
Aavegotchi -> Importing player data in game, creating custom animations, customising playe design with the chosen aaveotchi or other digital image (e.g. customising the game character, an astronaut, with your aavegotchi)

Put this in Notion!!!
