Boilerplate project for using the Moralis sdk with our project marketplace
This is the phaser component
Cadence is the web frontend (convert to react native later?)

To-do: insert this into react project (if it works with cadence/onflow.org client library)
Move into phaser three.js (3d phaser) with the same blockchain code after this (integrating with unity, generating additional scenes for trailer, companion app/trial game)
