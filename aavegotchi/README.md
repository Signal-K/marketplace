Boilerplate project for using the Moralis sdk with our project marketplace
This is the phaser component
Cadence is the web frontend (convert to react native later?)

## To-do: 
MOVE MORALIS SETTINGS INTO .env FILE!!

insert this into react project (if it works with cadence/onflow.org client library)
Move into phaser three.js (3d phaser) with the same blockchain code after this (integrating with unity, generating additional scenes for trailer, companion app/trial game)
Aavegotchi -> Importing player data in game, creating custom animations, customising playe design with the chosen aaveotchi or other digital image (e.g. customising the game character, an astronaut, with your aavegotchi)
Add another existing game into the phaser logic...

### Figure out how to fix potential lag
* Extending/exporting the db (something like airtable that we did before)
* Moralis will only contain extremely recent player position in the db
    However, we want players to be at checkpoints with their custom configurations at that time, etc
    Sending it to a different db service that is only called when the player requests it?


Put this in Notion!!!

Custom Moralis skin/ui (duplicating to airtable or some other visual frontend?)

Look at the ways we design the user flow for character vs (multiplayer) competitors and migrate this methodology to Unity
